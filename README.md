## Minimum Workspaces - Gnome-Shell Extension

Set a minimum number of workspaces to exist at all times. Any additional workspaces are still created and removed dynamically.

[Fork from https://github.com/philbot9/gnome-shell-minimum-workspaces]

### Supported versions of Gnome-Shell

40+

### Installation

As this is a non-official fork until upstream version is updated, currently only install via git is suggested.
Do not use this version if you do not dare to use git or want an official release.

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
git clone https://github.com/theseer/gnome-shell-minimum-workspaces.git minimum-workspaces@philbot9.github.com
```

Note: This will replace the original upstream version in case it got installed the same way.
